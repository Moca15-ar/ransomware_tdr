VERSION = 1.2.0
RELEASE = oct 2022
STABLE = True

######## THEORETICAL FEATURES ########
- creates key in the same directory as function files
- encrypts any kind of data on a specified directory
- creates .txt file claiming that the data has been encrypted
- decrypts the data

######## ADDED SINCE LAST VERSION ########
- key is created on function files' directory, not on wd because wd may vary from one execution to another
- readme.txt automatically removed before decryption
- key.key file removed after decryption

######## BUGS ########
- unable to encrypt folder's content

######## FIXED ########
- decrypt function: cryptography.fernet.InvalidToken on line 21 : a .txt file was created on the encrypted folder claiming that the data had been encrypted. 
    when the function decrypt was called, this not encrypted .txt file caused an error because a non-encrypted file cannot be decrypted. So if this file is 
    deleted just before decryption, it won't interfere
